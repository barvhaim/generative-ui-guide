## Introduction

Generative UI is an emerging paradigm in which AI systems not only power the logic behind an application but also generate the user interface itself in real time. Traditional graphical user interfaces (GUIs) rely on static layouts defined by designers, but generative UI allows models to assemble custom interfaces—cards, charts, forms, maps, diagrams—on the fly based on the user’s goals and context. This shift turns AI from a “black box” text responder into a visual collaborator that uses dynamic layouts to communicate its reasoning, request permissions and display results. By producing interactive experiences rather than walls of text, generative UIs enhance transparency, reduce cognitive load and unlock new applications such as interactive research dashboards, adaptive shopping flows and agentic workflows.

## Why generative UI matters

- Structured input and feedback: Generative UI provides the user with forms, tables or selectors, encouraging precise input and enabling the AI agent to gather the necessary parameters rather than interpreting long text descriptions.
- Task‑specific layouts: The interface adapts to the task; for example, a travel query can trigger itinerary cards with flight details, while a vulnerability analysis agent can display CVE timelines and exploitability tables.
- Visualized reasoning: Agents can externalize their planning and intermediate results, building trust by showing progress and tools used, rather than hiding reasoning steps in hidden chains of thought.
- Personalization and accessibility: AI‑generated interfaces can be personalized to a user’s preferences or device characteristics. This fosters inclusive design because layouts can adjust for different screen sizes or user roles.
- Efficient development: Designers and developers can specify high‑level components or data schemas instead of hand‑coding every layout. The AI fills in details, saves time and scales personalization across many users.
